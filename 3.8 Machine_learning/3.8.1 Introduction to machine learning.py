#What's machine learning?
#Machine learning is using a computer to generate knowledge from data
#an example can be  image recognition

#When we humans see an image of an animal or an object  we instatntly recognize them
#beause we know them
#it's easy for us, because we have inteligence. 

# In order for the computer to do the same thing we gonna have to provide
#an number of similar images, so the computer can learn how to recognize an object

#That's what's called AI!

#Machine learning is a part of A.I field

#There are also some subdivisions like deep learning which is the rechnology used to make self-driving cars

#We will use psychic learn which is a library that provides 
# hundrets of statistial models and machine learning tools

#to continue with machine learning we will be using jupyter
