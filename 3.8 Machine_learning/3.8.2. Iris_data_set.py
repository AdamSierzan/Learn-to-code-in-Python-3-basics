#iris is a very common dataset
#due to its simplicity and the fact we can import the dataset directly from psychic learn

#With the use of the IRIS we will use 150 observations of from the "IRIS DATASET"(Which is a database of defferent
# #iris flower examples)

#we will use that 150 observations to train our computer

#Next, we will apply statistical models to make our comuter learn to identidy the species of an Iris flower, by it;s measurment

#Next we will give the computer new measurements of and iris flower
#and it's goind to tell us from whcih species it is with a very low error rate
