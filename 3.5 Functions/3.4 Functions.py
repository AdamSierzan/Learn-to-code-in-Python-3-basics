# In this lesson we will talk about functions 
# With fuctions we can reuse the blocks of code in our programme
# When there's a set of operations that we use more than one time in our program, we can 
# put it inside a function, and instead of repeating those lines of code, we can
# invoke the funcion every time we need it
# To do it, we will use "def" statement
# We will pick a variable, 
def say_hello(): #we should pass the arguments of the functionin the parentesis, but here we can skip it
    print("Hello")
#now we can see that nothing happens here, because when we create a function, the code is not executed
#we're just creating a function
#If we want to execute it we need to invoke the argument#
#to do so we just write the name of the function and open and close the parentesis
say_hello()
#what if we want to pass argument to our functions
